                    <h2>Short Bio</h2>
                    <p>I was born in Surrey, but I grew up in a small city in Northern B.C. by the name of Prince Rupert. I spent my life there until high-school graduation, 
                        where I traveled to Ontario to studying engineering at McMaster University. I decided that engineering was a discipline I could not pursue, so I returned home 
                        to work at a grocery store for a year.<br><br>
                        My parents sent me to a school in the United States by the name of University of Nebraska - Lincoln, in Lincoln, Nebraska.
                        I tried studying accounting there for a year before returning empty handed again. I did a year of crabbing with my father before deciding to pursue an eduction that I 
                        would be proud of at BCIT.

                    <h2>Why I Chose D3</h2>
                    <p>I decided on BCIT's Digital Design and Development program because I felt that it would help me express my creativity and apply it to a career I would enjoy. 
                        While my specialty in drawing is stickmen, D3 has given me a chance to express my creative side through web design, Photoshop, and other means that don't require
                        me to expose my drawing talent. <br><br>
                        Meeting other like-minded individuals will also help me broaden my horizons and help me develop as a creative individual. The instructors at this institute all 
                        have their own experiences that they share among the class as well, helping us grow professionally.

                    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
                    <p>While I don't have any formal education, I learned hip-hop dance off of Youtube videos and was able to showcase this talent several times throughout high school and 
                        during my time at Mcmaster University. I think dancing has given me a better understanding of how music can influence atmosphere and mood, not just through dance, but 
                        also for other uses, such as for films, advertisements, and video games.<br><br>
                        I also have interest in video games and their soundtracks. Video games are a great outlet for many musical producers to express themselves, and I appreciate music that 
                        properly complements its own story. Games also all have their own designs for UI, character and world design, and story. These creative elements, visual and written, all 
                        come together to offer the player a rich experience. It is an experience that I have come to enjoy and appreciate when I need a breather from my academic work.<br><br>
                        Anime is also a perfect outlet for all of these creative elements to come together. The soundtracks, visual elements, and story all come together to offer a pleasing experience 
                        in any genre. Whether its a relaxing slice-of-life, an intense drama, or a heroic adventure, there are stories available to people from all walks of life to enjoy.
